# Multiples-of-A
# The first file multi_code.py was my first attempt on this code challenge,
# Then I was working on the ways to improve, make it simpler, or even add functionality like use of decimal numbers, which was planned in the original
# limited by the way the input was checked at the start of the file
# The a_until_x_ultrashort was an attempt to use range() function in some more creative way, and I've managed to produce the same results in just 2 lines of code
# There are no input checks and validation, but that wasn't the ultimate goal in this case, it can obviously be added or simply transfered from multi_better.py file
